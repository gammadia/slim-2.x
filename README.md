A fork for modern days [![CI](https://github.com/gnutix/slim-2.x/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/gnutix/slim-2.x/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
==========

This is a fork of `slim/slim` at the version `2.6.3` adapted for modern PHP development, which (supposedly) supports :

* PHP `7.2` <-> `8.1`

Feel free to contribute if you find any issue!

The following changes were applied to the dev dependencies :

* PHPUnit upgraded to `8.x`
* PHPStan baseline added to keep the code in good health (runs only on PHP 8.0)
* Rector installed to ease automated refactorings
* Add GitHub Actions for continuous integration
